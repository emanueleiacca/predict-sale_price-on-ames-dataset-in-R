Different Algorithms with the Ames Dataset

Overview:

This repository contains the code and resources for my project on predicting sale prices using different algorithms with the Ames dataset. The goal of this project is to explore various machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performance in predicting the sale prices of houses based on the provided dataset.

Dataset:

The project utilizes the Ames Housing dataset, which is a comprehensive dataset containing 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The dataset provides information such as the quality of the house, its size, the type of utilities available, and many other features that may influence the sale price.

EDA Phase:
During the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, the following steps were performed:

Outlier Detection: Outliers in the dataset were identified using appropriate techniques such as box plots, scatter plots, or statistical methods. Any outliers that significantly deviated from the majority of the data were treated or removed from the dataset.

Correlation Analysis: The correlation between variables was examined to identify highly correlated features. This step helps to avoid multicollinearity issues in the subsequent modeling phase.

Log Transformation: In cases where variables showed skewed distributions, log transformations were applied to normalize the data and improve the performance of certain algorithms.

Handling Categorical Variables: Categorical variables were transformed into dummy variables. This process converts each categorical variable into multiple binary variables, representing the presence or absence of a category. Dummy variables enable the utilization of categorical data in machine learning algorithms.

Algorithms Explored:

This project explores the performance of several machine learning algorithms for predicting house sale prices. The algorithms implemented and compared are:
Ridge
Regression Tree
Random Forest 
Pruning
PCA
Lasso
KNN
Boosting
BSS

Results and Evaluation:

The project evaluates the performance of each algorithm in terms of prediction accuracy and error metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) value. These metrics help to compare and understand the effectiveness of each algorithm for the given task.

The evaluation results and insights are provided within the code files and can be further analyzed and visualized using appropriate visualization techniques.

Conclusion:

This project aims to provide an in-depth understanding of different machine learning algorithms' performance when applied to the task of predicting house sale prices. By comparing and analyzing the results, it offers valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and their suitability for this specific problem.
